# About me

I have 4 years experience in the finance industry - 1.5 years as a Private Debt Analyst in the Structured Finance department for two different investment funds, 2 years as a Corporate Credit Analyst at SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale in Chicago, and 6 months as a Corporate Risk Analyst at Natixis in Paris.

In early 2021, I decided to explore and work in data, so I learned coding in **SQL** and **Python** on my own. Then I joined an intensive Data Science bootcamp at Le Wagon in Paris, where I developed different skills:
- **Data Analysis** with SQL, Pandas, Numpy.
- **Machine Learning and Deep Learning** with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow/Keras.
- **Data Engineering** with GCP, Heroku, Github.

Later on, I completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and worked on a project using **SQL**, **R** and **Tableau**.

With 3 of my teammates from Le Wagon Bootcamp we built in 2 weeks a **sign language module** which recognizes through a webcam and display on the screen the different letters of the alphabet:
- Based on the American Sign Language.
- The Sign Language Translator uses computer vision and image segmentation.
- Our dataset includes more than 8000 pictures of hand signs both homemade and from online datasets.
- We used the Resnet50 V2 Convolutional Neural Network in order to classify the different letters.
- The cropped image of the hand from the webcam is the input we give to our model and the classified letter the ouput.

### Context
Data Analysis Case Study for Google Data Analytics Certification - Cyclistic. Preparing a data analysis for a fictional bike-share company in order to help them attract more riders.

### Project Overview
As a data analyst working in the marketing analyst team, my goal was to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

Cyclicist is a bike-share company that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations.

We try to evaluate how do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently:

Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are considered casual riders.
Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

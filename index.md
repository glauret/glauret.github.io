## Sign Language Detection Project ðŸ––
## Deep Learning
[Github project link](https://github.com/glauret/Sign_language_detection)

**Tools used: Python (Numpy, Panda, OpenCV, Mediapipe, TensorFlow), Google Drive, Streamlit**

### Context
![Module](assets/img/Image_2)

With three of my Bootcamp (Le Wagon) teammates build in 2 weeks a sign language module which recognizes through a webcam and displays on a screen the different letters of the alphabet:
- Based on the American Sign Language
- A Sign Language Translator using computer vision and image segmentation
- Dataset includes more than 8000 pictures of hands position both homemade and from online datasets
- We used a Convolutional Neural Network with transfer learning from Resnet50 V2 in order to classify the different letters of the alphabet for a given image of the hand

## Cyclicist Project ðŸš²
## Data Analytics
[Github project link](https://github.com/glauret/project_cyclistic).

**Tools used: R (Tidyverse, Geosphere), Tableau**

### Context
Data Analysis Case Study for Google Data Analytics Certification - Cyclistic. Preparing a data analysis for a fictional bike-share company in order to help them attract more riders.

Project Overview
As a data analyst working in the marketing analyst team, my goal was to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

Cyclicist is a bike-share company that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations.

We try to evaluate how do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently:

Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are considered casual riders.
Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.

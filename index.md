# About me

I have 1.5 years of experience in Data Analytics and 4 years experience in the finance industry. After coming back from Chicago where I worked as a Corporate Credit Analyst for a French Investment Bank, I attended an intensive Data Bootcamp in Paris and took my first steps in the Data World

Quickly after, I joined  Ankorstore as a Business Data Analyst. Ankorstore is the fastest growing European B2B marketplace reaching unicorn status in only two years. The company's mission is to connect brands with the best independent retailers in Europe. 
My role involved:

**-Conducting data analysis** to support business decision-making on CX and Logistic topics 
**-Developing and implementing data visualization tools** to monitor the performance of the Fulfillment Center and improve Sales processes 
**-Creating and monitoring new metrics** to better understand brands behaviors on the platform

I completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and I'm currently working on the Advanced Certificate.

With 3 of my teammates from Le Wagon Bootcamp we built in 2 weeks a **sign language module** which recognizes through a webcam and display on the screen the different letters of the alphabet:
- Based on the American Sign Language.
- The Sign Language Translator uses computer vision and image segmentation.
- Our dataset includes more than 8000 pictures of hand signs both homemade and from online datasets.
- We used the Resnet50 V2 Convolutional Neural Network in order to classify the different letters.
- The cropped image of the hand from the webcam is the input we give to our model and the classified letter the ouput.

### Context
A data analysis Case Study for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification. The objective was to prepare a data analysis for a fictional bike-share company located in Chicago, Cyclicist, in order to help them attract more riders.

### Project Overview
As a data analyst working in the marketing analyst team, my goal was to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team had to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

Cyclicist is a bike-share company that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations in Chicago area.

We try to evaluate how do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently:
- Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are considered casual riders.
- Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
